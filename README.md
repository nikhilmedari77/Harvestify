The Crop Management System is like a smart helper for farmers. It uses fancy computer techniques to guess which crops will grow best, tells farmers what fertilizers to use, and predicts how much rain there might be and how many crops they'll get. It's like having a knowledgeable friend who helps farmers make smart choices about their crops.
